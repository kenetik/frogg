      | Why You Should Use It
    p.lead
      strong #{title} 
      | is a starting point providing a sensible, configurable, and customizable set of choices.
      | You get a turnkey web app that provides common patterns such as environment-specific configuration files,
      | clustering for multiple cores, SSL certificate setup, database connections, logging transports,
      | and caching and compression of content.
    p.lead
      | The experience of building a production-ready, deployable web application 
      | involves making many choices: which technologies, what configuration settings, best practices, etc.
      | While there is no one right set of choices, these are ones I have used in my own production 
      | web application and have found to be not only pragmatic and scalable, but a pleasure to work with.
      | My hope is this might help you get off the ground fast so you can focus on building that awesome idea
      | you've got in your head.
